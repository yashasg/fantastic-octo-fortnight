## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

### 2026-04-24 — M1.2 + M1.5 Phase 1 UI layer

- **OverlayView lives in UIWindow with no EnvironmentObjects.** `OverlayManager` creates `OverlayView` via `UIHostingController` without injecting any environment objects. OverlayView must be self-contained — no `@EnvironmentObject` for SettingsStore or AppCoordinator.
- **Settings gear = dismiss overlay.** Since `ContentView → NavigationStack → SettingsView` is always the root app view, tapping the Settings gear button calls `onDismiss()`, which tears down the overlay window and reveals SettingsView underneath. No extra routing needed.
- **Swipe UP to dismiss** (`translation.height < 0`). This is non-obvious — upward drag has a **negative** Y translation in SwiftUI's coordinate space.
- **`isDismissing` guard prevents double-calls.** Both the manual dismiss path and the timer auto-dismiss path gate on `isDismissing` to ensure `onDismiss()` is called exactly once.
- **Fade animations require an `opacity` state var.** `.onAppear` fades in with `overlayAppearCurve`; manual dismiss fades out with `overlayDismissCurve`; auto-dismiss fades with `overlayFadeCurve`. The overlay is presented via `UIWindow.makeKeyAndVisible()` so the hosting controller doesn't own the transition — we own it in SwiftUI state.
- **`SettingsViewModel` is `@State` (not `@StateObject`) in SettingsView.** It's `@MainActor final class` but SettingsView only calls action methods on it — never observes its `@Published` properties. `@State` is the right tool to keep the VM alive across view updates without triggering re-renders.
- **Notification permission warning banner** reads `coordinator.notificationAuthStatus == .denied` and shows a deep-link button to open System Settings. `SettingsView` calls `coordinator.refreshAuthStatus()` in `.task` on appear to keep this accurate.
- **`ReminderType.color` returns `AppColor` tokens.** `.blue`/`.green` was the original default. All views use `type.color` as the single accessor, so the fix in `ReminderType` propagates everywhere (OverlayView icon, countdown ring, ReminderRowView toggle tint).
- **`AppFont` must use semantic text styles** (`Font.TextStyle`), not fixed `size:` parameters. The only exception is `AppFont.countdown` (64pt monospaced, decorative) which is intentionally non-scaling. The mapping: `.title.weight(.bold)` for headline, `.body` for body, `.headline` for bodyEmphasized, `.footnote` for caption.
- **`OverlayView` Reduce Motion pattern:** `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) private var reduceMotion` guards all three animation paths (appear, manual dismiss, auto-dismiss). When true, set opacity directly and schedule `onDismiss()` after a 50 ms grace period.
- **Countdown ZStack accessibility:** Use `.accessibilityElement(children: .ignore)` + `.accessibilityLabel("\(n) seconds remaining")` on the ZStack. Both Circle views get `.accessibilityHidden(true)`. Icon Image gets `.accessibilityHidden(true)` (headline covers it).
- **`import UIKit` required in `SettingsView.swift`** for `UIApplication.openSettingsURLString`. SwiftUI does not implicitly export UIKit on current toolchains.

### 2026-04-25 — String Catalog Extraction & Migration (Decision 2.19)

- **Deliverable:** `Localizable.xcstrings` with 73 keys, all 6 views migrated
- **Convention:** `screen.component[.qualifier]` with dot-separation, camelCase (e.g., `home.title`, `settings.doneButton`, `overlay.countdown.label`)
- **Format strings:** `%@` (String), `%d` (Int), positional syntax `%1$@/%2$@/%3$@` for complex interpolations
- **Accessibility:** Keys with `.label` and `.hint` suffixes for VoiceOver (e.g., `settings.snooze.cancelButton.hint`)
- **Extraction state:** All keys set to `extractionState: "manual"` to prevent Xcode auto-removal/insertion
- **Views affected:** HomeView, SettingsView, OverlayView, OnboardingWelcomeView, OnboardingPermissionView, OnboardingSetupView
- **Usage patterns:** `Text("key")` for SwiftUI, `String(localized: "key")` for programmatic strings, `String(format:)` for interpolations
- **Build verified:** `./scripts/build.sh build` → BUILD SUCCEEDED
- **Decision filed:** `.squad/decisions/decisions.md` (Decision 2.19)

### 2026-04-25 — Data-Driven App Configuration (Danny Decision 3.6)

- **Full config spec filed:** `app-config.json` bundles theme (colors, fonts, spacing, layout, animations, symbols), defaults (reminder intervals, enabled states), copy (all strings), and features (flags).
- **DesignSystem refactor scope:** All `AppColor`, `AppFont`, `AppSpacing`, `AppLayout`, `AppAnimation`, `AppSymbol` tokens read from `AppConfig.current.theme` at startup; no hardcoded literals except fallback struct.
- **Views read copy pattern:** All user-facing strings move from inline literals to `AppConfig.current.copy` accessors.
- **Reset to Defaults feature:** Add button in SettingsView Advanced section; clears UserDefaults, re-seeds from bundled JSON.
- **Acceptance criteria:** 10 criteria cover loader, unit tests, all sections, appearance modes, test injection, no regression.

### 2026-04-24 — P1/P2 Review Fixes + M2.2 Haptics + Snooze UI

- **`Color` extension (named asset + fallback()) was dead code.** All production code uses `AppColor` literals. Removed the whole `Color` extension block to eliminate P2-2 dead code. If an asset catalog is added later, `AppColor` is the extension point.
- **Countdown VoiceOver pattern revised.** The static label `"Countdown timer"` goes on `.accessibilityLabel`; the live value `"\(n) seconds remaining"` goes on `.accessibilityValue`; `.updatesFrequently` trait ensures VoiceOver polls the value. Previous pattern combined both into accessibilityLabel — that's less idiomatic.
- **Haptic generators are `@State` optionals, created in `onAppear`.** Using `@State private var impactGenerator: UIImpactFeedbackGenerator?` avoids UIKit API calls before the view is on screen. Both impact and notification generators are `.prepare()`d immediately in `onAppear` for zero-latency haptics.
- **Haptic event model:** overlay appear → `.warning` notification haptic; manual dismiss → `.success` notification haptic; countdown completion → `.medium` impact haptic. System silent mode silences all automatically — no explicit check needed.
- **`hapticsEnabled` flows via call-site parameter, not singleton.** `OverlayPresenting.showOverlay` accepts `hapticsEnabled: Bool`; AppCoordinator passes `settings.hapticsEnabled`. This keeps OverlayManager testable and avoids SettingsStore coupling in the UIKit layer.
- **Snooze UI is purely view-driven.** `isSnoozed` is a computed var on `SettingsView` (`settings.snoozedUntil != nil && until > Date()`). Snooze buttons call `viewModel?.snooze(for:)` which was already implemented by Basher. "Rest of day" computes `minutesUntilEndOfDay` inline from Calendar.
- **`SettingsView` re-uses `@State private var viewModel: SettingsViewModel?` for snooze actions.** The viewModel is always non-nil by the time a user taps a snooze button (initialized in `onAppear`). Optional chaining via `?.` is safe and correct here.

### 2026-04-24 — Settings dismiss / HomeView navigation

- **`HomeView` is now the NavigationStack root.** `ContentView` swapped from `SettingsView` to `HomeView` as the root of the post-onboarding `NavigationStack`. Key file: `EyePostureReminder/Views/HomeView.swift`.
- **SettingsView is presented as a `.sheet` from HomeView.** Inside the sheet, a fresh `NavigationStack` wraps `SettingsView` so the large-title nav bar and toolbar items work correctly. `EnvironmentObject`s (`SettingsStore`, `AppCoordinator`) are re-injected into the sheet because sheets don't inherit the environment automatically in all iOS versions.
- **SettingsView uses `@Environment(\.dismiss)` for the Done button.** `.toolbar { ToolbarItem(.navigationBarTrailing) { Button("Done") { dismiss() } } }` is the canonical iOS pattern for dismissing a sheet-presented settings screen. `dismiss()` targets the sheet's `NavigationStack`, not the outer one.
- **HomeView status display reads `settings.masterEnabled` directly.** No VM needed — it's read-only display. Icon/color toggled between `AppSymbol.eyeBreak` (blue) and `"moon.zzz.fill"` (secondary) to communicate reminders active/paused state at a glance.

### 2026-04-24 — Data-Driven Default Settings Spec (filed by Danny)

- **Your ownership:** Add "Reset to Defaults" button to `SettingsView` with confirmation alert. Button is destructive style, behind a confirmation. Calls `SettingsStore.resetToDefaults()` (Basher will implement this API).
- **Context:** Problem is hardcoded Swift defaults require recompile. Solution: bundle `defaults.json`, seed UserDefaults on first launch, let user changes persist. Reset clears all `epr.*` keys and re-seeds from JSON. UI updates immediately.
- **Basher implementation:** `DefaultsLoader` (JSON decoder), `SettingsStore.init()` seeding, `resetToDefaults()` API, remove `ReminderSettings.defaultEyes/defaultPosture` statics.
- **Key file:** `.squad/decisions.md` (merged from inbox; filed by Danny)

### 2026-04-25 — String Catalog (Localizable.xcstrings)

- **`.xcstrings` lives in `EyePostureReminder/Resources/`** and is declared via `.process("Resources")` in Package.swift (the entry was already present). SPM processes it into the main bundle automatically.
- **Key convention: `screen.element`** (e.g. `home.title`, `settings.doneButton`, `overlay.countdown.label`). Accessibility labels/hints get a `.label` or `.hint` suffix on the parent key.
- **Format string keys for interpolated values.** Three patterns used: `%@` for String args (snooze time), `%d` for Int args (countdown seconds), and `%1$@/%2$@/%3$@` positional specifiers for the SetupPreviewCard triple-arg label. Call site: `String(format: String(localized: "key"), args…)`.
- **`Text("key")` vs `String(localized: "key")`**: `Text`, `Toggle`, `Section`, `Button` title, `.navigationTitle`, `.accessibilityLabel`, and `.accessibilityHint` all accept `LocalizedStringKey`, so bare string literals like `Text("home.title")` work. `String(localized:)` is needed when the result must be a `String` (computed vars, format args, `Button(String(localized:))`).
- **`Label("key", systemImage:)` uses `LocalizedStringKey`** — the string literal is the key, no extra wrapping needed unless the value contains interpolation.
- **73 keys total** across home (5), settings (28), overlay (6), onboarding.welcome (7), onboarding.permission (11), onboarding.setup (16) screens.
